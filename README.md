### Hi there 👋

Thanks for visiting my profile! I hope you'll find whatever you're looking for. 

I believe that the best way to learn is by creating things, which is why you can find here all kinds of projects 
in many different programming languages. You can use those as a reference or base of your next project. 

I also solve a real life problems. If something doesn't work I just make it work, if there's no support I just
make support for it. \
Anything is possible if you can write anything! 

I love open-source software so all of my personal projects are [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software). 

### Tech stack:
- **OS:** Arch Linux
